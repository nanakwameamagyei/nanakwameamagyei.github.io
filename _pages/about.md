Hi everyone! Did you know that it takes a lot of human labor to create and process scientific data? Yes, and in my PhD thesis, I explain what this work is, how it is done, why it is necessary, and what impact it has on sustainable digital innovation.

I am Nana, a PhD student researching data curation practices at the Department of Computer Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim, Norway. You can find more about me on my NTNU profile <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/nana.k.h.amagyei">here</a>.

My current research interests include:

<ul>
  <li>Data Curation in Practice</li>
  <li>Big Data Management</li>
</ul>

Drawing on an interpretive research philosophy, I use a range of qualitative methods inspired by ethnography to explore how people appropriate technologies in their everyday work. My main focus is on investigating the production and management of digital data and associated technologies in a way that maximizes both the long-term viability of the data and the technology and considers the wider social and ethical implications.

I obtained my Bachelor of Science (BSc.) in Computer Science and Statistics from the University of Ghana. I also hold both a Master of Science (MSc.) and a Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at GIMPA.

My primary academic field is Information Systems and Computer Supported Cooperative Work.
